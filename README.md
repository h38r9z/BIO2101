BIO2101 Comprehensive Biology Laboratory
Exercise 3:      Cell Culture
Purpose: To understand the conditions that limit cells'   ability to   survive   and   proliferate   in   vitro.
Introduction:
Cell Growth   CurveTechniques for growing cells in the laboratory were originally developed by   microbiologists.   The    rapid    generation    time    of    most    microorganisms    as    well      as    their   autonomous   growth   and   relatively   few   nutritional   requirements   made   it   easy   to   provide   the   cells with   an   optimum   environment   and   to   avoid   contamination   by   other   organisms.   In   the   past   50   years   these   techniques   have   been   extended   to   the   culture   of   cells   from   higher plants and animals.   Using cell culture, one can address questions relating not only   to    cell    growth    per    se      but      also      to      nutritional      requirements,      metabolic      activity,      gene   expression,    motility,    and    features    of   differentiation,    aging,    and    regulation.    The    chief   advantage of animal or plant cell culture   is the   control   the   investigator   can   exert   over the   cells'   environment   in   the   absence   of   influences   from   other   systems   of   the   multicellular   organism.   It   is   important   to   keep   in   mind,   however,   that   the   laboratory   culture   cannot   reproduce    every    detail    of    the    cell's    natural    surroundings,    and    some    of    the    missing   properties   may   be   significant   to   the   process   under   study.   Thus,   cell   culture   is   a   model   system, a simplified version of what   is understood to   be "real   life."When growth   is   not   limited   by the composition of   the   medium, cells   are   said to   be   in   "exponential"   or   "logarithmic"   phase:   in   each   successive   time   period   the   size   of   the   population   increases   by a constant factor.    Represented   mathematically,

where   N   is the   number of cells   present at time t and   k   is   a   growth   constant   that   depends   on that cell type and those   growth   conditions.
Rearranging:

Integrating   between (No, to) and   (N,t):   In   (N/No)   =   kt
The population doubling time   is the value of t for which   N/No    = 2.      Moreover,   a
plot of ln (N/No) as a function of twill   be   a   straight   line whose   slope   is   k.      (Even   simpler is to   use semi-logarithmic graph paper,   plotting t along the   evenly   spaced   axis   and   N/No   on the axis   perpendicular to   it.)    If you   know the   initial   number of cells and   the   growth   rate constant, the size of a culture   in   log   phase   can   be   predicted   at   any   subsequent   time.Exponential      phase      is      usually      limited      by      the       availability      of      nutrients      or    the   environment's carrying capacity for waste.    At that point the population growth slows until   the   culture   is   in   stationary   phase,   where   cell   death   balances   cell   division   and   even   cell   division   may   be   slowed.      Cells   in   adult   organs   of   most   higher   animals   are   in   stationary   phase.      If conditions   become   sufficiently   adverse,   a   death   phase   may   ensue.    A   growth   curve   is the   result of an experiment to   measure the characteristics of the various   phases   of a   population of a certain cell type under a   defined   set   of conditions   (see   Figure   1).

Cell Culture TechniqueWhen   working   with    cell    culture,    it    is    absolutely    essential    to    maintain    sterility.   Typical   bacterial   contaminants   double   in   number   every   30   minutes,   and   1   to   2-hour for   molds.    Several measures are customarily taken to   ensure   sterility:
1.      Sterilize everything   likely to come   into contact with the culture.      Media   and   glassware   may    be    autoclaved;    disposable    plastic    ware    has    been    sterilized    by    radiation    or   treatment with gas, and should remain wrapped before use; tools and implements can   be dipped   in alcohol and   flamed.
2.    Work   in   a   clean   protected   area   whenever   possible.       The   ideal   situation   is   to   use   a   biological    safety    cabinet    (“tissue    culture      hoods”),    whose    air      environment      is   filtered to remove   particles.
3.    Avoid opening sterile containers for   longer than   necessary   to   sample   or   inoculate.
4.      In some cases, it is advisable to include antibiotics such as   penicillin or streptomycin   in the culture   medium.
Cell   Number Measurement
Cell   number in the culture   medium can be   accessed   by   the followings,
•          Hemocytometer
A device for cell   number counting as described   in   Exercise 2
•          Electronic cell counting
In   which   a   particle   passing   over   a   charged   orifice   interrupts   the   charge   and   is   recorded as a pulse.    The number of   pulses is a measure of the number of particles in the   volume   that flowed   past the   orifice.    This   procedure   is   useful   if   you   have   large   numbers   of cells and   many samples to count, as in   a   clinical   hematology   laboratory.
•          Using   protein assay to monitor   cell   growth
It   is sometimes   necessary to determine   how   much   protein a cell   contains   in   order   to   learn   something   about   the   characteristics   of   the   cell   or   to   compare   one   cell   type   to   another.    Once that value   is obtained,   one   can   use   the   amount   of   protein   in   a   cell   lysate   as a measure of   the number of cells lysed.    It is possible to measure the amount of protein   per   cell   using   the   Bradford   procedure,   providing   that   you   have   enough   cells   to   produce   more than   10   μg of protein, and   you   know   the   number   of   cells.      Cells   in   suspension   can   be collected by centrifugation, lysed in detergent, and assayed for protein calorimetrically.
Demonstration:
Key features   of sterile technique will   be   briefly   demonstrated   at the   beginning   of   the   lab   session.
Procedure:
A.         Construction of Growth Curve of HL-60   cell   cultureA   stock   culture   of   HL-60   cells   in   log   phase   will   be   provided   in   a   37oC   incubator   containing   5%   CO2   .      Each   group   is   required to   prepare two   growth   curves   on these   cells, one under optimum conditions (RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine   serum (FBS) and one under sub-optimum conditions (RPMI   1640 medium containing   4%   FBS).
1.       Using aseptic technique, transfer   16   mL   of   1640 with   20%   FBS   to   a   T75   sterile   flask,   labeled 20%; and   16   mL of   1640 with 4%   FBS to another T75 flask,   labeled 4%.
2.       Using   aseptic   technique,   transfer   4   mL   of   the   stock   cell   culture   to   both   flasks   from   Step   1.
3.       Gently shake the flasks   several   times.      Label   the   flasks   with   your   group   number   and   session   L01 or   L02.
4.       Using    a    micropipette   and   tip   with   aseptic   techniques,   take   0.2代 写BIO2101 Comprehensive Biology Laboratory Exercise 3: Cell Culture
代做程序编程语言   mL   of   “20%”   to   a   microfuge tube.    Similarly, take 0.2   mL of “4%” to   another   microfuge   tube.
5.       Use the   hemocytometer to   determine   the   concentration   of   cells   in   the   two   cell   suspensions   from   Step   4   (cell   concentration   on   day   0),   as   you    know   from   Exercise 2.    Once the cells   are   taken   from   the   culture   flask,   they   no   longer   need   be   handled sterilely.
6.       Calculate the mean (the average number of cells/square) and standard deviation of   your readings from the eight “A” squares on the hemocytometer.    The concentration   of   cells   in   the   sample   is   given   by   the   mean   count   x   104    cells/mL.       Remember   to   correct this concentration by the dilution factor if required, and   to   convert   the   unit   to   x   106   cells/mL.    Record all data on the   Experimental   Datasheet accordingly.
7.       On   day   1,   3,   5   and   6,   repeat   Step 4 for   sampling   of your   two   cultures.       Further   dilution of   the sample is required if the cell concentration is > 70 x 104    cells/mL.
Pay   close   attention   to   aseptic   technique   when   sampling   to   avoid   the   cell   cultures   being contaminated.
Note: Exact   date   of   sampling   would   be   announced   by   the   instructor.
B.                   Preparation   of Cell   Pellet   for   Protein Assay
1.       Transfer    1   mL   of   cell   suspension   from   “20%”   and   “4%”   culture   flasks,   by   aseptic   techniques, to two   microfuge tubes,   respectively.    Label   the   test   tubes   with   “20%”   or   “4%”, your group   no., session and the date with a   marker   pen.
2.       Using   a   swing   out   rotor   and   centrifuge,   spin   down   the   cells   at   3,000   revolutions   per   minute (rpm) for 5-minutes. (This operation   is done   by   instructor   or   TAs)
Note:    Whenever the centrifuge is   used, the   rotor   must be   balanced   with   tubes   on   opposite sides containing equal   volumes.
3.       When   the   rotor   comes   to   rest,   remove   tubes   and   carefully   discard   the   supernatant   (but   keep the   pellet!).    The pellet   now contains the   cells.
4.       Resuspend the cell   pellets with   0.5   mL   phosphate   buffered   saline   (PBS).   Repeat   the   centrifugation    step    as       in    Step      2      to      obtain      the      cell      pellets      again.       Discard    the   supernatant and save the   pellet.
5.       Store the samples   (cell   pellet)   at   -20oC.      (From your   determination   of   cell   density   in   Part   A,   you   should   know   the   number   of   cells   in   the   pellets   from   the   two   cultures,   respectively.)
6.       Repeat Step   1 to 4 on   each sampling   day   of   Part   B   and   save   the   corresponding   cell   pellets for lab session of   next week.
Part C and   D should   be   done   in the   following week.
C.                   Construction of Protein Standard   Plot   (Bradford Assay:   96-well   plate)We   can   use    Bradford    reagent   to   determine   the    protein   content   of   bovine   serum   albumin   (BSA)   in   order to   construct   a   standard   plot   as   reference.      Bradford   reagent   contains   a   dye,   Coomassie   blue,   which   binds   to   protein.      The   dye/protein   complex   produces    a    blue    color    whose    absorbance    is    directly      proportional    to    the      protein   concentration.
1.          BSA   has   been prepared   in   0.05% Triton X-100   at   a   concentration   of   0.6   mg/mL.
2.          Using   an   aliquot   of   the   0.6    mg/mL   protein standard    prepare   a   range   of   standards   solutions in   EP tubes. Add the following volumes of 0.6 mg/mL   protein standard   and   0.05% Triton X-100 (labeled   as BSA dilution buffer) (Table 1) to the appropriate wells   to construct a range of   standards solutions between 0 and 0.6 mg/mL (e.g. 0, 0.0375,   0.075, 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6   mg/mL).   Mix   the   content   by   vortex.   A   total   volume   of   50   μL   of each standard is sufficient for all the   required   assays.

D.                     Cell   Lysis and   Protein Assay
1.       To   lyse   the   cells,   suspend   each   cell   pellet   in   0.5   mL   0.1%   Triton X-100.       Break   up   the clumps of cells   by vortex.
Think about: How does   Triton X-100   lyse cells?
2.      Immerse the tube in 95oC test tube heat blocks for a minute or two,   to help the proteins   go   into solution.
Note:   Use tweezers to   avoid burns.
3.      Once the pellet   is solubilized, dilute each sample   2 folds   by   adding   50   μL   of each   cell   sample   into 50   μL of ddH2O.   Mix the content   by vortex.
4.Add   10   μL of standard or cell   lysate sample   (2   repeats) to the   appropriate wells   on   96-   well   plate.
5.    Add 200   μL of Bradford   reagent to   each well.         Wait   for   3-minutes.   Full   color   development should occur within   3-minutes.
   
Figure 3. An example of how standard and   samples   can   be   presented.
Note: Because the Bradford reagent contains phosphoric acid,   avoid contact   with   the mouth   or skin.6.    After   3-minutes,   measure   absorbance   at   595   nm with   microplate   spectrophotometer   (BioTek   Epoch   plate   reader)   .    Record   the   absorbance   value   on   the   datasheet   (P.   9)   .Optional   Step:   If   the   protein   amount   of   a   sample   exceeds   the   upper   limit   of   the   standard   plot, dilute 50 μL of   this sample with 50   μL of   *0.05%   Triton   X-100, then use   10 µL   of   diluted sample for measuring absorbance,   accordingly.    Record the   dilution factor   on   datasheet, if   necessary.
l    For operation   of   spectrophotometer, please   consult   TA.
For Data   Processing on   Laboratory Write-up:Plot your data on graph   paper,   mg   protein   on the   X   axis   and   A595   on   the   Y   axis   (for example, See   Figure 4).    Calculate the coefficient of   determination   and slope of   the   regression   line.    The coefficient should be   >   0.9.

Figure 4. A typical standard curve for the protein   assayCalculate the   amount   of   protein   per well.       Correcting for   dilutions   (if   necessary),   calculate the total   amount   of   protein   per   ml   in   each   lysate.       Knowing the   number of   cells   that   were   collected   to   obtain   each   lysate,   calculate   the   amount   of   protein   per   cell   in terms of nano grams (ng)   of   protein   per   cell.      Show   all   calculations   on your   laboratory   report.
